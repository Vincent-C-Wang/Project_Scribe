Here's a general guideline for committing: (ignore quotations)

0.) Both the remote repo and your local repo need to be sync'd before everything else, so [git fetch] and [git pull] to grab the latest 
    stuff from the remote repo.

1.) Assuming you're on the same branch you've been working on and want to commit changes to, use [git add *].

2.) Do [git commit -am "[some message]"] to create the commit.

3.) Then do [git push] to actually upload the commit to the remote repo.(edited)
