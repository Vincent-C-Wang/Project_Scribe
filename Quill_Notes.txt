Notes on rich text editor implementation so far:

see the import statement in default_index.js to find problem.

import Quill from '/quill-1.3.6/quill.js';//error here Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
Object.definePrototype(Vue.prototype, '$quill', { value: quill });


ideally we want something like

var quill = new Quill('#editor', {
          theme: 'snow'
          });

in the vue component so we can call<div id="editor">...</div> to have the editor there.
The reason why the CDN method doesnt works is that vue 
has no idea how to handle that when its in the html.
if we get that import to work then we can move forward with testing it more
